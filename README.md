# 🚨 Helpora – Smart Disaster Management & Relief Coordination Platform

Helpora is a full‑stack web application that connects disaster victims with nearby NGOs in real time. Victims can report emergencies (including SOS), specify needed resources (type & quantity), and receive live status updates. NGOs can view nearby reports, get intelligent match recommendations, manage their inventory, and coordinate responses – all in real time.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Role‑based authentication** (Victim, NGO, Admin) with JWT & bcrypt
- **Real‑time disaster reporting** (Socket.io) – new reports appear instantly on NGO dashboards
- **Geospatial matching** – NGOs see reports within a configurable radius (MongoDB `2dsphere` & `$near`)
- **Smart resource allocation** – Victims specify needed resources (e.g., food 50 kg, water 100 L). NGOs see match badges and a ranked list of nearby organisations
- **Auto‑deduction of resources** – When an NGO accepts a report, requested quantities are deducted from their inventory
- **Low‑stock alerts** – NGOs receive real‑time warnings when a resource falls below 20 units
- **Request & response history** – Victims can view all their past reports; NGOs see their accepted/resolved reports
- **Interactive map picker** – Leaflet + OpenStreetMap with BigDataCloud reverse geocoding (free, keyless)
- **Admin panel** – Verify NGOs, view system statistics (total reports, pending reports, etc.)
- **Forgot / reset password** – Secure token‑based flow
- **SOS flag** – Overrides report urgency to “critical” and triggers immediate alerts

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account (free tier) or local MongoDB

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/helpora.git
   cd helpora
   ```
2. Backend Set Up
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
3.Frontend setup
  ```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```
4.Run the app

Backend: ```cd server && npm run dev```

Frontend: ```cd client && npm run dev```
5. Open ```http://localhost:5173```

Testing

1.Register a victim and an NGO (NGO needs location)

2.Victim creates a report with needed resources

3.NGO sees report with match badge, accepts → resources deducted

4.Victim receives notification; history updates

5.Admin verifies NGOs and views statistics
